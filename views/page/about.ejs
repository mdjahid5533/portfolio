With way too many languages and frameworks, one tend to ponder which one would be the right one to choose for a given application. In recent past the debate of Java vs JavaScript is taking mainstream. According to us, JavaScript is rapidly overtaking Java, which would be the one language that a web developer should learn. In this blog let us do a deep dive of top 5 reasons why JavaScript is the choice over Java.</p> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-12"> <br> <h4>History of JavaScript </h4> <p class="lead">JavaScript has a very rich and fascinating history. It was created by Brendan Eich (co-founder of Mozilla) during his time at Netscape Communications in 1995. Originally called Mocha (a name chosen by Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape). It’s inspired by Java. In Sep 1995, JavaScript name was changed to LiveScript. Then in Dec 1995, upon receiving a trademark license from Sun, the name JavaScript was adopted. The general-purpose JavaScript engine had been embedded in web browsers (Netscape, IE, etc..). The ECMA-262 (European Computer Manufacturers Association) Specification defined a standard version of JavaScript language. There have been multiple editions of JavaScript, details are provided below. <br> </p> <div class="lead" style="margin-left: 20px; line-height: 30px;"> <strong class=""> . ECMAScript Edition 1 is the First standardized version of JavaScript. <br> . ECMAScript Edition 2 is the second official standard, in order to make JavaScript implementation more standard by different vendors. <br> . ECMAScript 4 (ES4) added support for features such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) & class based object-oriented programming. <br> . ECMAScript 5 (ES5) was released in December 2009. It added features for robust programming via a strict mode and better way to handle JSON <br> . ECMAScript 6 (ES6) was released in June 2015, and is the latest official version of JavaScript. It has added more backend features that can be used in runtime environment like Node.js </strong> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-12"> <br> <h4>Reason 1: One language for frontend and backend programming </h4> <p class="lead">As called out in the introductory section, JavaScript was originally introduced as a <strong>front-end interpreted language.</strong> It’s main goal is to bring <strong>interactivity with users</strong> by bringing features like event handling, forms, browser handling and document (HTML) handling. This continue to be true with <strong>94.5% of world’s top 10 million websites use JavaScript</strong> in the frontend. We can even go ahead and say JavaScript is the only interpreted language that is universally accepted by all web applications and browsers. The most interesting part of JavaScript is, it doesn’t stop here. Creators of JavaScript continued to add more interesting features which has resulted in <strong>JavaScript started ruling the backend programming as well.</strong> <br> <br> When it comes to backend there were already many languages existing (PHP, Java, Ruby, Python etc..). So the norm was to learn one programming language for front end and another one for backend. This got changed with the introduction of <strong>node.js (which is a JavaScript runtime environment),</strong> which has emerged as the #1 framework by developers. JavaScript is also one of the fastest growing OpenSource (ranked 4th) that enables developers to build scalable, lightweight web applications with ease. With these unique advantages, JavaScript scores significantly higher than Java by emerging as the only language that can be used both in frontend and backend programming. This has truly enabled <strong>fullstack web development</strong> phenomenon! </p> </div> <div class="col-md-12"> <br> <h4>Reason-2: Develop Faster and Smoother </h4> <p class="lead">From writing less number of lines to re-using packages, there are many features that makes JavaScript development a breeze. Let us take a look into them one-by-one: <br> <strong>1. Re-usability:</strong> In the server side JavaScript programming, there is a great set of library available in form of <strong>Node Package Manager (NPM).</strong> It has more than 7 lakh packages or libraries available for re-use, thereby emerging as the biggest repository in the world. Such extensive support is not available for Java, which speed up the development. </p> <img src="/images/1.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block m-4"> <p class="lead"><strong>2. Lines of Code:</strong> In JavaScript lesser lines of code achieve more functionality, unlike Java. This is mainly due to the interpreted nature of JavaScript, which offers higher level of abstraction. Availability of many rich features and libraries (ex: NPM as called out above) developers can achieve same functionality with lesser number of lines than Java.</p> <p class="lead"><strong>3. Scalable:</strong> JavaScript is a scalable language. It has an event driven framework which consumers lesser amount of resources than Java. This makes it lightweight and efficient, thereby reducing load on the backend. Combined with non blocking I/O, JavaScript enabled developers to create scalable web applications. </p> <p class="lead"><strong>4. Tools:</strong> There are various tools available for JavaScript developers. It gives an OpenSource ecosystem support for best-in-class editors/IDE. It also provides some excellent tools with zero cost like Sublime Text, Gulp, NPM, Webpack, Eslint, etc. Such tool ecosystem increased the productivity of developers.</p> </div> <div class="col-md-12"> <br> <h4>Reason-3: Easy to Learn, faster to master:</h4> <p class="lead">Java is an object oriented programming language whereas JavaScript is an object based scripting language. Many of their programming structures are similar. However, JavaScript contains a much <strong>smaller and simpler set of programming constructs than Java.</strong> Also it can be easily read and understood by developers than many other programming languages. As a developer an individual get started with JavaScript in the front-end and make a transition into fullstack developer as mentioned in the diagram below. It offers many easier aspects in the frontend (ex: weakly typed) that makes JavaScript having one of the <strong>smoothest learning curves</strong> when it comes to developers.</p> <img src="/images/2.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block m-4"> </div> <div class="col-md-12"> <br> <h4>Reason-4: Most Popular Language </h4> <p class="lead">JavaScript has emerged as a flexible and powerful programming language, implemented consistently by various web browsers. By foraying into backend JavaScript has become very popular because it has turned web browsers into application platforms or single page applications. It also continue to expand into innovative technologies like <strong>virtual reality, gaming, animation and rendering.</strong> More breakthroughs in JavaScript are emerging as it makes into device or embedded systems programming thereby playing a significant role in <strong>Internet-Of-Things (IoT)</strong>, thanks to upcoming JavaScript frameworks like Cylon.js.</p> <p class="lead">In summary it is becoming a <strong>swiss army knife</strong> of programming languages, where it can be used for many purposes at different context. No wonder it continue to be one of the most popular programming languages (refer – image below).</p> <img src="/images/3.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block m-4"> </div> <div class="col-md-12"> <br> <h4>Reason-5: Great Statistics </h4> <p class="lead">Last but not the least – Numbers and Numbers! JavaScript has great statistics here are some of them for your reference. </p> <div class="lead" style="margin-left: 20px; line-height: 30px;"> <strong class=""> . More than <strong>900000 servers</strong> deployed Node.js which is the highest growth rate among all <br> . Job opportunities for those who have excelled in JavaScript has increased immensely. There have been more than <strong>25000% increase in job opportunities</strong> all over the world for JavaScript developers and more companies are finding it difficult to hire JavaScript talent. <br> . More than <strong>10000 companies</strong> are asking to include Node.js as the key skill to hire people which even includes the top 5 companies. JavaScript is the most trending and popular language among all the FullStack web developers globally among all surveys, thereby demonstrating a great future. </strong> </div> <img src="/images/4.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block m-4"> </div> <div class="col-md-12 mb-5 pb-5"> <br> <h4>Conclusion:</h4> <p class="lead">JavaScript has emerged are more versatile programming language than Java. It was due to many reasons — continuous development, backend usage, multiple domain growth, ease of use, efficiency, tools etc. On the other hand Java has not achieved this level of growth even though it is still widely used. Given that scalability is going to be a key requirement of modern day web applications and cross-functional paradigms like IoT it getting into mainstream, JavaScript has positioned itself as the numero uno that the developer should learn.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div></div><%- include('../partials/footer') %></body></html>
